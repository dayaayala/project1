            <p> For more than 50 years, the Rock, a 97.5-ton hunk of Knox dolomite stone, has served as an iconic campus symbol.<br> <br> 
            
                The corner of Volunteer Boulevard and Pat Head Summitt Street is visited often by people equipped with spray paint, paints cans, and brushes. Through our messages on the Rock, we have celebrated victories, expressed opposition, remembered those we've lost, shared joy, and when necessary, stood united against hate. The Rock's messages are seen by thousands of people passing by each day.<br> <br> 
                Significant moments have been reflected on the Rock for decades including a memorial to Pat Summitt, messages to our athletic rivals, wedding proposals, and baby announcements.</p>
