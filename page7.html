           <p> <ul> In its 50th year above ground, the Rock became a canvas for Payton Miller, who held the unofficial title of painter of the Rock until her graduation in 2017. <br> <br>

            Following the death of legendary women's basketball coach Pat Summitt in June 2016, Miller's painting memorializing Summitt remained untouched through most of the summer and is believed to be among the longest-lasting images.<br> <br>
            
            Approximately 1,050 cans of spray paint, 300 hours of work, and 30 paintings later, Miller took her final bow with a painting of Smokey holding a spray paint can.<br> <br>
            
            In fall of that year, the campus celebrated 50 years of the Rock by sharing their memories and images. The News Sentinel reported on the milestone.
