          <p> <ul> In its earliest days, a small portion of the Rock was visible on the lawn of Calvary Baptist Church, which was located where Fraternity Park is now.<br><br>

           In 1966, after the site had been acquired by the university, the Rock was unearthed by the A.B. Long Company during grading work for streets and buildings.<br><br>
           
           Later that year, the university began the process of selecting a name for the hunk of stone. The Daily Beacon reported the names that had been advanced, including Kissing Rock, the Fellowship Stone, the Volunteer Image, and the Rock. The simplest of those names the Rock was chosen.</ul> </p>
