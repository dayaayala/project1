         <p> <ul> In February 2019, the community came together again to remember and reflect on the events of the previous year. The day included a volunteer fair, painting the Rock, and a closing ceremony with remarks and music. <br> <br>

         In October, a livestream from the Rock was launched to provide a view of the changing messages and artwork, while creating community accountability for a space that belongs to everyone.</ul> </p>
